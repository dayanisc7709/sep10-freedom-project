* Read this website --> https://medium.com/w3bvr/learning-a-frame-adding-image-textures-5dbb7c41288
    * Allowed for me to learn about images and textures
        * (Very helpful in case for my project)
    * Helps with making our surroundings not look too plain or boring
      * `src="url link here"` is the way to put images over shapes
    * Would something like gifs or anything animated may also work to put on the shape?
    * Is there a size limit on these images when putting them on shapes?
* Result from using tutorial (Works!):
