# Entry 1: Deciding on the topic (Fashion)
##### 10/23/23

# Choosing the topic
The topic I've decided to talk about is Fashion. This is something that I am passionate about, so I think dedicating myself to this topic will do me good. I think Fashion is a great thing because there are endless possibilities in what outfits you can create or wear. I also had some backup ideas in case this one didn't work out. I had two more ideas, such as
##### - visual arts 
##### - animation
It didn't work for me because while it is something I also enjoy doing, I don't think it's something I can keep holding onto. Fashion is something I can definitely keep researching about and keep finding new things about it during the researching. Some of the websites that I found that intrigued me were, "[The impact of technology on the fashion industry](https://www.thefashionisto.com/the-impact-of-technology-on-the-fashion-industry/)" and "[Three ways technology is significantly impacting the fashion idustry](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2021/06/08/technology-and-fashion-an-innovative-ensemble-now-in-vogue/?sh=1bfc330e7aabhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2021/12/09/three-ways-technology-is-significantly-impacting-the-fashion-industry/?sh=5fa30503718f)" The first link tells me about how technology has disrupted the fashion industry. It makes go through a lot of changes that make it easier for people to see and check clothes. The second link tells me about how technology makes it so that customers can get exactly what they want in measurements, size, type of clothing, anything they want with fashion and the technology helps them set it all up. Another two websites I found were [Tech in Fashion: 11 Fashion Technologies for Innovative Brands](https://3dlook.ai/content-hub/top-11-fashion-technologies/#:~:text=Apparel%20industry%20technology%20trends%3A%2010%20fashion%20technologies%20for,consumers%20desire.%20...%207%207.%20Augmented%20reality%20). I didn't exactly read through all of it since it was very long, but I did a quick check and found that it said that Fashion technology is helping the world by reducing its environmental footprint by using harmless materials, being less wasteful, etc. The other website I looked through was "[What tech innovation means for the business of fashion](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/what-tech-innovation-means-for-the-business-of-fashion)" and it mentions that technology helps customers with discovering new brands and types of clothes that maybe they'd have have a good take on.

# Engineering Design process
So far I am currently in the first step of the process, which is defining and I'm also in the second part of the EDP, which is researching the problem. What I'm trying to define here is the topic that I will talk to everyone about and about how technology is involved in it and how it helps it progress further in a good way. But to do that, I need to do more research on fashion and which technologies are used to advance it. Like for example, in fashion, 3D models are used to easily see the clothing on a body in case they can't see it for real.

# Skills
In this project I got to learn some new things, like basic skills. Some of the skills that I learned throughout this was:
##### - How to google
##### - How to read
Right below this, I'm gonna talk about what I actually learned to be specfic.

# How to google
So before this project, researching was sometimes a hard thing for me to do since I never quite know what to type or search for or how to put it into words in the search bar. So this whole thing is allowing me to get used to the hang of it a litte now. I know how to do small stuff now like filtering and how to specify for things I am looking for. So now it won't be as confusing for me to think of what to type and having to look through each article only to find that they're not what i really needed. It's happened to me a lot, including while I was researching, but thankfully it won't happen as much anymore, atleast I'd sure hope for that!

# How to read
During this, I learned how to read as well, not just how to google. While searching for articles and websites for my topic I ran into a few problems here and there, mainly just websites not being what I was exactly looking for. Not a big deal, right? It shouldn't really be, but here it was since there was a bit of a time limit. I didn't really try to read through them, I tried to skim through them so it'd be quicker. But then I realized maybe I had to take my time and get to check the details. I stil skimmed through some, just to see if any words intrigued me. That kind of worked actually and helped me find my four websites as sources.

# Other notes
I'm a bit nervous, but I'm excited to start researching about fashion and hopefully get to know about a potential job i can look into in the future.
