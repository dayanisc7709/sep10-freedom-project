## What I learned about Aframe

During my time on learning about Aframe, I learned a lot of useful stuff that will help me in the future with the website making. The things I learned to do in Aframe are making shapes, creating scenes/background, adding text, etc. Making shapes in Aframe is really important since that's like, the most basic thing in it. Along with scenes/backgrounds, they are important because it's where all the shapes are being put into and it gives it more of a better look. Another thing I learned to do was add images onto shapes so they also don't look too plain. I could also add text next to the shapes if I wanna do that too, which I'm gonna go further on in the next section.

## How I learned Aframe

At first, I tried learning Aframe by grabbing the basic code from it's website and tinkering with it in Js.bin. I didn't realize that I could just make a file and put the code there, so I used that at the beginning. One of the first things I did after getting a grasp on how the shapes work, I wanted to know how to put images over the shapes, so I went on Js.bin and did that using 'src="url link here"'. Using that after the name of the shape is typed, an image will appear over the shape and it'll look like a texture, so something like this:

Another thing I learned was using different types of lights on shapes. There are four types of lights that I found, there could be more. The names of them are: directional, spotlight, hemisphere, and ambient. In Js.bin, I tried tinkering with all except ambient. I think the ambient one was too bright, so I had no idea how to fix that type of light, so I never used it. This was the code that came out in the end:

As said before, I tried changing the colors. I also did stuff like position, intensity and angle to see what it would do. Then I added a space background, since it kind of looked like a planet in a way:

Another big thing I learned was creating text. That was gonna be a big thing I needed since I picked Aframe to be able to create a visualization of the invention I had in mind and explain it there. It took a lot of time to figure it out since I did whatever was said in the text section of the official Aframe site, but nothing worked. So I went over to youtube to find a tutorial and it ended up working. All I had to do was change the version of Aframe from '1.5.0' to '0.5.0'. After that I was able to get the text working with the code. Since this was near the last few days of learning, I also tried making one of the inventions in my list, which turned out like this:

This was supposed to be like an AI bot that would help with fashion, so the body was most difficult to do. I tried messing around with the position and radius to get it look like a body. Then I added the text, which for some reason, still worked after I changed the version '0.5.0' to '1.5.0'. I'm still not sure why, but atleast it worked. There was more I learned, but that was more of the important things I learned.

## Sources

Some of the sources I used were mainly from the Aframe website, which is https://aframe.io/. Another source I used was a youtube who helped me a lot during this process with her tutorials that were really helpful, which is https://www.youtube.com/@alexandraetienne9540.
