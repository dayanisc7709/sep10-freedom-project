## Takeaways from giving EXPO elevator pitch
A takeaway that I got from giving my elevator pitch was time management. I messed a little when giving my speech, so I think I needed to spend more time on practicing what I had planned to say, so that I'd be able to remember it better than how I did. But then, it got repetitive anyway, so I learned to improvise too when giving the pitches because it was the same thing over and over. So changing it up and improvising on the spot is kinda necessary, especially because other people arrive and they wouldn't want to hear the exact same thing. So it was fine to not completely remember the speech, since it was gonna be changed anyway. But it was important to remember the most important parts of the pitch speech.

## Takeaways from giving in-class presentation
A takeaway that I got from giving my presentation in class was to give more eye contact to the audience. I struggled with looking back at the audience since I was nervous. That's definitely something that I need to work on for the next time I give any presentations since eye contact is a vital part of any presentation. I also didn't get to explain my website or the A frame invention I had as well. My voice was a little low or quiet when I presented, so that is another thing. Cause of that, my other takeaway is to make my presence more known when I give presentations. So basically, I need to be more louder and try to explain every single thing that's being presented, so that others can get engaged and interested in the presentation.
