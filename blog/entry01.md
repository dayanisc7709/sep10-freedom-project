# Entry 1: Deciding on the topic (Fashion)
##### 10/23/23

# Choosing the topic
The topic I've decided to talk about is Fashion. This is something that I am passionate about, so I think dedicating myself to this topic will do me good. I think Fashion is a great thing because there are endless possibilities in what outfits you can create or wear. I also had some backup ideas in case this one didn't work out. I had two more ideas, such as
##### - visual arts 
##### - animation
It didn't work for me because while it is something I also enjoy doing, I don't think it's something I can keep holding onto. Fashion is something I can definitely keep researching about and keep finding new things about it during the researching. Some of the websites that I found that intrigued me were, "[The impact of technology on the fashion industry](https://www.thefashionisto.com/the-impact-of-technology-on-the-fashion-industry/) and [Three ways technology is significantly impacting the fashion idustry](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2021/06/08/technology-and-fashion-an-innovative-ensemble-now-in-vogue/?sh=1bfc330e7aabhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2021/12/09/three-ways-technology-is-significantly-impacting-the-fashion-industry/?sh=5fa30503718f) The first link tells me about how technology has disrupted the fashion industry. It makes go through a lot of changes that make it easier for people to see and check clothes. The second link tells me about how technology makes it so that customers can get exactly what they want in measurements, size, type of clothing, anything they want with fashion and the technology helps them set it all up.
