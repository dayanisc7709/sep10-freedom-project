* (Keeping code here to potentially use in the future for project)

2/29/24:
* Read this website --> https://medium.com/w3bvr/learning-a-frame-adding-image-textures-5dbb7c41288
    * Allowed for me to learn about images and textures
        * (Very helpful in case for my project)
    * Helps with making our surroundings not look too plain or boring
      * `src="url link here"` is the way to put images over shapes
    * Would something like gifs or anything animated may also work to put on the shape?
    * Is there a size limit on these images when putting them on shapes?
* Result from using tutorial (Works!):

3/4/24:
* Watching tutorials from this channel --> https://www.youtube.com/@alexandraetienne9540
     * Has useful things to use for Aframe, like light and skyboxes
          *Merged two tutorials and got a result of making a space themed scene:

* Light helped with shading objects in a way, like in art
* Skyboxes help imagine where you are and get a better vision
     * `<a-sky src="image link here"></a-sky>` is how to be able to put a 360 image around the scene
     * `<a-light type="name here"></a-light>` can allow me to put light around the directions, with a color
          * Directional, Spot(light), hemisphere and ambient are the four different types of light (Need more reasearch on the spotlight and ambient one)
       * Example of code down below:
