## How I made my MVP
The way I was able to make my MVP was mainly by using the wireframe I made from before. It helped me on the path to make a simple version of my website. It had the general layout that I wanted so being able to look back on it was a great help. But to actually make the website, I used components and images to make up the website. I also needed my content from the first semester to fill up the site with text. Some of the components I had in the wireframe were carousel, navbar, etc. Also before I really worked on the components and adding my own content, I needed images that relate. So I went onto Google and found my images and saved them for later. Adding my old content was more important out of everything else besides the components. Then afterwards, it was quicker to fix the components and see what worked and what didn't instead of going back and forth.

## Challenges & Takeaways
Some of the challeges I faced were within the images of the project. When I put them in, they were all over the place kind of. The sizes didn't help. I wanted the carousel to be smaller, since it looks too big, but I left it like that and thought it was fine as it was. But the other images were still weird looking because of the sizes. For that, I'm gonna use the `weight` snd `height` attribute to fix it and make it look normal as possible. Another challenge that I faced was putting Aframe in the website. I am still unsure how to put it in, like embed it, for now I have created a seperate file for the Aframe code and finish it. A takeaway I took from this was that it's fine if I don't end up finishing everything and if it doesn't look good, if it works, then it's fine.

## EDP (Engineering Development process) 
I think so far I'm currently on the sixth or seventh step of the process. The prototype being the MVP
