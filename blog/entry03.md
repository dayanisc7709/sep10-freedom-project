# Entry 3: Brainstorming Part B anf finalizing

## How I brainstormed about Part B
When I had to think about Part B, I looked back on my software and hardware I already had planned out for my website. Those would give me ideas for some future products I could come up with. I thought that maybe there could be so much more to technology than there is to it right now. I thought about virtual themed products, something like VR fits. I thought that there was a way to expand on the software and hardware there already is in Fashion. When I had VR and AI in mind, that led me to coming up with an AI helper. That was the first idea I had gotten and I had more details for it than any other, so I may have grabbed some inspo from those details and placed it on the other future products I had in mind. The AI Fashion helper would be able to be on your side and help with anything Fashion related that you need. For example, it'd help you find out what your style is and find clothes from that style immediately. If you ever feel like switching it up, then the AI helper would change as well and show off other styles for you test and love. It'll switch up just as you do as well since it would be your personal helper. Another few things that this AI can do is that it'd give a virtual avatar for you to test on clothes if you're not too sure yet for an outfit. it can give tips and suggestions for makeup looks depending on what style you're into so that's another plus. For my other ideas, they were mainly VR since I feel that VR products would be easier to come up with in Fashion. One of these ideas would be a Fashion world for other people into Fashion can get into it and talk to others, so it's like an interactive VR game, like most of the other future ideas are too. You can talk to people in it and even collaborate on Fashion projects to make an outfit from scratch, then once you are done, everyone who had worked really hard on it would receive that outfit that was created or even sell it to others. My other ideas are VR so I think the point is already through so I won't need to talk about it. So that's how I was able to brainstorm for Part B, with the help of the software and hardware that's already meant for Fashion.

## How I finalized my content
Once I was able to do all of this, I needed to organize it all and add some more facts to it so that I'd be sure it was fine to put on my future website. The way I was able to do this was by seperating everything in three sections since there was the software, hardware and future products. I think it would be confusing to not seperate the software and hardware, so that's what I did so it wasn't hard to confuse it.
