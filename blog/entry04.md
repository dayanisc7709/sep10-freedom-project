## What tool I have chosen
The tool I hae chosen to learn more about and get to know well is Aframe. It's a web framework that's meant for building 3D or VR experiences. These experiences can be viewed anywhere and can also just be made easily in HTML. Some basic things can be accomplished, like basic shapes, coloring, adjusting sizes and etc. There is even starter code on its official site to help you get started and get used to how the functions in it. Aframe also doesn't need to get installed or anything like that, which makes things a lot easier to use. it's put to good use if you wanna learn how to make basic environments for VR and maybe get a taste of how games are made.

## How I tinkered with it
To get used to Aframe, I needed to search for the official sites, tutorials, starter codes and anything related to it so that I'd learn more about it. So I found one of its official sites and it had some started code ready to use and I was able to tinker with that in js.bin. With that, I tried looking at what Aframe had in store for it's basic starter code. There were some adjusted shapes and a simple background already there in place. From there, I tried checking how the code works, like with the positioning, the angles, etc. Once I kind of figured out how the current functions work, I needed something simple to make. Then I tried making a little robot of sorts, since it doesn't have legs to practice for when I make some of my future inventions in my list. I think it turned out okay, cause it was what I had in mind to make. Plus for something basic, I think it was pretty good. Down below is the code and the image of my creation:

It was a little hard to make since obviously, that was my first time using Aframe, but I think I can get the hang of it. But one thing that was difficult was taking note of what shapes I was focusing on making changes to because I reused the shapes a few times, so color coding with different shades of grey really helped out. I think for the next time, I will try to use more shapes or see if I can create different ones to add more variety and not keep on using the same ones.

## Sources
For my sources, I mainly used the Aframe website as help. It had all the things I needed, like the starter code. I also found more shapes to use as an idea there, it looked hard, but I will see if I understand that later on. The Aframe websites are where I also saw examples of other creations from other people using the shapes and images to create some games or just places to look around at online. Here are some of the websites I had found:

## Skills

### Organization
During the tinkering, it was kind of messy and it got confusing for me to figure out which shape I was making changes to because I had multiple reused shapes, so I had to do something about this problem. What I did was use my skill and organized them by color coding them with different shades of grey to make it more easier for me to look at which shape is which for the body in the robot I was making. This made my tinkering a little easier, thanks to me actually organizing them with colorcoding.

### Embracing failure
While I was tinkering, I made quite a lot of mistakes in my coding. I made a lot of errors when fixing the placement adjustments since I got confused a lot. But through those errors, I still was able to get through it and learn what I did wrong. Each time I got a little better as I went on with my errors. Also having these errors means Aframe isn't that easy to use for me, so I can learn more from this program. I don't wanna make too many mistakes, but the ones I did have already were good since it was a good learning experience.
