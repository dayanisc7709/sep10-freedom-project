## What tool I have chosen
The tool I hae chosen to learn more about and get to know well is Aframe. It's a web framework that's meant for building 3D or VR experiences. These experiences can be viewed anywhere and can also just be made easily in HTML. Some basic things can be accomplished, like basic shapes, coloring, adjusting sizes and etc. There is even starter code on its official site to help you get started and get used to how the functions in it. Aframe also doesn't need to get installed or anything like that, which makes things a lot easier to use. it's put to good use if you wanna learn how to make basic environments for VR and maybe get a taste of how games are made.

## How I tinkered with it
To get used to Aframe, I needed to search for the official sites, tutorials, starter codes and anything related to it so that I'd learn more about it. So I found one of its official sites and it had some started code ready to use and I was able to tinker with that in js.bin.
